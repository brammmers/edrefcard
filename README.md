# EDRefCard
A reworked utility to generate printable reference cards for Elite Dangerous controller .binds files

This website was heavily inspired by CMDR VerticalBlank's EDRefCard site, available here: http://edrefcard.info, GitHub source: https://github.com/richardbuckle/EDRefCard (please check that out for credits etc.)

This version, rewritten in PHP 8.3+ will hopefully "stand on the shoulders of giants", providing a more maintainable and secure codebase which can be hosted in more places.
